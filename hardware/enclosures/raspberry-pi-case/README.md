## Files

- **picase.scad** - OpenSCAD source file (parametric, editable)
- **picase.stl** - Ready-to-print 3D model

## Printing

### Recommended Settings

- **Material**: PLA or PETG
- **Layer Height**: 0.2mm
- **Infill**: 20%
- **Supports**: Yes (for overhangs)
- **Print Speed**: 50-60mm/s

### Battery Compartment

rglenn's sample prints include an integrated battery compartment for portable operation. This improvement allows the system to be truly wearable without external power cables.
