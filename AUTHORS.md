## Core Contributors

### Hardware Engineering

**rglenn** ([@rglenn](https://github.com/rglenn))
- **Production PCB designs** - Professional KiCad layouts for manufacturing
- **Gerber file generation** - Ready-to-fabricate PCB files
- **3D printed enclosure samples** - Battery-compatible enclosure prototypes (a delightful surprise!)
- **I2C system implementation** - Ported initial system to I2C architecture for PCB testing
- **Hardware testing and validation**
- **Precision assembly work** - Expert soldering for prototype testing (because steady hands and good eyeballs are underrated superpowers when dealing with 0402 components and microscopic traces!)

### Code Contributors

**rglenn** ([@rglenn](https://github.com/rglenn))
- I2C code implementation and testing for hardware validation

## Special Thanks

- **rglenn's steady hands** - For heroically soldering tiny components onto test PCBs when my hands get shaky and my eyeballs get twitchy. Not all heroes wear capes; some wield soldering irons with surgical precision! 🦸‍♂️🔧
- Adafruit Industries for the DRV2605L CircuitPython library
- The OSC (Open Sound Control) community
- Early testers and users who provided valuable feedback during development
