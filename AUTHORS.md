## Core Contributors

### Hardware Engineering

**rglenn** ([@rglenn](https://github.com/rglenn)) — *Hardware contributor (2019-2020)*
- **Production PCB designs** - Professional KiCad layouts for manufacturing
- **Gerber file generation** - Ready-to-fabricate PCB files
- **3D printed enclosure samples** - Battery-compatible enclosure prototypes (a delightful surprise!)
- **I2C system implementation** - Ported initial system to I2C architecture for PCB testing
- **Hardware testing and validation**
- **Precision assembly work** - Expert soldering for prototype testing (because steady hands and good eyeballs are underrated superpowers when dealing with 0402 components and microscopic traces!)

(Additional contributors will be listed here as they make contributions)

### Documentation Contributors

(Documentation contributors will be listed here)

## Special Thanks

- **rglenn's steady hands** - For heroically soldering tiny components onto test PCBs when my hands get shaky and my eyeballs get twitchy. Not all heroes wear capes; some wield soldering irons with surgical precision! 🦸‍♂️🔧
- Adafruit Industries for the DRV2605L CircuitPython library
- The OSC (Open Sound Control) community
- Early testers and users who provided valuable feedback during development
