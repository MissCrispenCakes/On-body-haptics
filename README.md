# On-body-haptics
multiple renditions of haptics

### integration can be found in my main VR project located at https://github.com/worldmaking/manusnode
^^ have removed from manusnode and will update a new repo shortly

### TO UPDATE HERE:   code for raspberry PI onbody with up to 8 buzzers  
=> need to add/update i^2c + wifi

### ALREADY UPLOADED: code for arduinos on body with 5 buzzers and raspberry pi running nodejs server to handle incoming osc to the onbody arduinos
#### CODE provided is a very simple example using pre-programmed buzzer patterns that can be adapted as you see fit. 


### /// wanted to give a large variety of code to tinker with
=> bluetooth\
=> spawn executable files\
=> server-client setup\
=> send messages\
=> regEx\
=> arduino sample code\
=> PCB layout etc\
=> more to come!
