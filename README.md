multiple renditions of haptics

## Branches

### 1. startup
Main info 
check startup branch
links to researchgate context (initial project)

### 2. Arduino_Node
Arduino with NodeJS + bluetooth

## Updates

### TO UPDATE HERE:   code for raspberry PI onbody with up to 8 buzzers  
#### => need to add/update i^2c + wifi EDIT: updated in I2C_python branch

## UPDATE 2020/2021: I2C and python for v2 octopulse (8 LRAs) added | all materials etc. see: haptics_v2_I2C

### ALREADY UPLOADED: code for arduinos on body with 5 buzzers and raspberry pi running nodejs server to handle incoming osc to the onbody arduinos

## NOTE ABOUT CODE

> code provided for haptic control is a very simple example using pre-programmed buzzer patterns that can be adapted as you see fit
> both arduino versions and raspberrypi versions have simple buzzer codes that demonstrate such options as:
>> how to hard-code specific patterns
>> 
>> various methods for flexible and live-updating of patterns
>> 
>> for the raspberrypi and DRV controller a PDF of use and customisation is included

### wanted to give a large variety of code to tinker with

#### => bluetooth\
#### => spawn executable files\
#### => server-client setup\
#### => send messages\
#### => regEx\
#### => arduino sample code\
#### => PCB layout etc\
#### => more to come!
#### => update: I2C, python, WiFi, new design
