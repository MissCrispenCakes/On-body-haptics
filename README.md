# On-body-haptics
multiple renditions of haptics

integration can be found in my main VR project located at https://github.com/worldmaking/manusnode
^^ have removed from manusnode and will update a new repo shortly

TO UPDATE HERE:   code for raspberry PI onbody with up to 8 buzzers  
=> need to add/update i^2c + wifi

ALREADY UPLOADED: code for arduinos on body with 5 buzzers and raspberry pi running nodejs server to handle incoming osc to the onbody arduinos

CODE provided is a very simple example using pre-programmed buzzer patterns that can be adapted as you see fit.
